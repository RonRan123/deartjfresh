        Dear TJ Freshmen was started by Mia Yang and Ronith Ranjan (Class of
        2020) when they were inspired by the site dearpennfresh.com. Their goal
        was to spotlight the diverse experiences and perspectives that students
        gain over their four years at TJ, and allow graduating seniors to share
        their parting words of wisdom. They hope to encourage incoming freshmen
        and current students and show that no matter the tough times they may go
        through, they will never be alone. After calling on friends to produce
        an initial batch of letters, they launched the site in late July of
        2020.

        The site had been dormant for a few years following their graduation as
        they became busy with college work. But with a redesigned website, the
        projects has been reestablished to continue sharing the stories from TJ
        students. The schools has changed through the years and we hope to
        capture an accurate and truthful portrait of the lives of TJ students.{" "}
